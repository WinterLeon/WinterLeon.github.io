I am currently and since October 2023 a Ph.D. student in Geometric Analysis under the supervision of Prof. [Jean Van Schaftingen](https://perso.uclouvain.be/jean.vanschaftingen/index.php?lang=en) at the [Institut de Recherche en Mathématique et Physique (IRMP)](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/irmp) of the [Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain)](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) in Belgium.

I am a Aspirant (Research Fellow) of the [Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/) since October 2025. Before that, I was funded by the Fond Spécial de Recherche (FSR) of the UCLouvain.

My work is on [Sobolev mappings between manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_mapping) with a particular focus on trace theory. I am generally speaking interested in topics in geometric analysis. I also enjoy learning about analytic number theory.
